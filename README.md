# Graph_Coloring_Problem-CSP
Implementation of an algorithm using MRV, LCV and AC-3 Algorithm to solve graph colouring problem. ( Constraint Satisfaction Problem )

This program takes an input from text files provided.

There are three implementations

1. Basic Backtracking Search
2. MRV Heuristic
3. LCV Heuristic
4. Heuristics with Arc-Consistency

The output will also show the graph visualization.
The program terminates once a solution has been found.

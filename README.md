# Graph_Coloring_Problem-CSP
## Constraint Satisfaction Problem
Implementation of an algorithm using MRV, LCV and AC-3 Algorithm to solve graph colouring problem.

This program takes an input in the form of the text files provided. The same format must be used

There are four concepts that have been implemented for accurate predictions

1. Basic Backtracking Search
2. MRV Heuristic
3. LCV Heuristic
4. Heuristics with Arc-Consistency

If a solution exists the it will print the color of each node and graph visualization.

# Graph_Coloring_Problem-CSP
## Constraint Satisfaction Problem
Implementation of an algorithm using MRV, LCV and AC-3 Algorithm to solve graph colouring problem.

This program takes an input from text files provided.

There are four implementations

1. Basic Backtracking Search
2. MRV Heuristic
3. LCV Heuristic
4. Heuristics with Arc-Consistency

The output will also show the graph visualization.
The program terminates once a solution has been found.
